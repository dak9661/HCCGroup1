		<h2>Olive's Analysis</h2>
		<p>I tested our index card prototype on two of my residents. They were asked to go through the process of completeing three tasks:
			getting to assignments for a PSYC 240 class, getting to their  Fall 2020 course list and lastly getting to their class list for 
		their ISTE 262 as shown on the index cards. I feel I had to over explain the index cards a bit becasue they weren't familiar with 
			the processes. They were able to complete the tasks after explain with no gudiance. The only issues That I faced when doing 
			this is that they felt the naviagtion was not clear enough/ large enough. The issue was also that for the button to find the classes
			from previous semesters was called sort instead of smething more descriptive or pertaining to the content. Over all naviagetion is 
			something that that we need work on. It was good to see how a user may interact with our app and know what we should
			improve before building the hifi prototype.  </p>

		<h2>Kimberly's Analysis</h2>
	<p> 
		Participant 1
		Major: Software engineering
		<br>
		Frame 1:
		When viewing the landing page instantly said “this is for MyCourses” 
		He knew the purpose of the app 
		<br>
		Frame 2:
		“What if I don’t have an account”
		Knew what was text input, pressed the login page 
		<br>
		Frame 3:
		Questioned if that was the home page 
		<br>
		Frame 4:
		Confused at first but when he saw the label “priority” and “color” he assumed it was an edit option but didn’t know for what.
		<br>
		Frame 5:
		Wasn't sure where the frame came from. Selected spring 2022.
		<br>
		Frame 6:
		“Is this a to-do list?”. He mentioned that would be a cool feature for Mycourses
		<br>
		Frame 7:
		Knew it was menu-selected content. “Where would I select the menu to get to this page” 
		<br>
		Frame 8:
		“Why do I select the names, what’s the purpose”
		<br>
		Frame 9:
		Selected the button, questioned if that was the same frame he pressed 
			
		<br> <br>
		Participant 2
		Major: Business Management 
		<br>
		Frame 1:
		“It’s a mycourses app”
		<br>
		Frame 2:
		Logged in no problem. Tapped login button
		<br>
		Frame 3:
		Took a couple of seconds to figure out what it was, he said because of the lines in the boxes he thought it was crossed out. 
		<br>
		Frame 4:
		Asked if this page is when the user selects the assignments. Wasn’t positive of what the page was. 
		<br>
		Frame 5:
		“Where does the back button go to” he knew that the page was for each semester
		<br>
		Frame 6:
		Was reading out loud from top to bottom. Said that these are assignments listed that are due
		<br>
		Frame 7:
		Knew that it was options, he related it to the options are the same from the desktop
		<br>
		Frame 8:
		He asked if the boxes next to the names were icons or if he can select them. When I asked him if he knew what the page was the said the class list but he wasn't too sure
		<br>
		Frame 9:
		He viewed the top of the page. After seeing fall 2020 he said that the classes listed are for that semester. He knew the purpose of the page easily.
		<br><br>
		Analysis: After testing the lo-fi on the 2 participants, Partcipants were confused on where they were at, having a title on each page will help users understand the page. Also it seemed that the particpants tried to recall the features used in the mycourses website to complete tasks. 
		Keeping alike layouts from the desktop can help users recognize and improve efficiency and comfort. Labeling buttons will help users as well especially the back button. In addition, having a feature to show where the user is currently at can help users know where they are at. Having an active state on the icon/menulist they are in can help with that

		<h2>Dylan's Analysis</h2>
		<p>After testing the lo-fi prototyoe on two participants using scripted questions to guide the test,
		   I found some flaws with the app design. Some of these flaws were due to errors in the lo-fi prototype. 
	           The particpants were mostly confused how to interact with the paper model. After some explination the 
		   participants procceded. I asked the particpants to complete a task of adding an assignment for a specific class.
		   The users were able to complete the task with few errors. After completion, I asked for feedback. 
		   The participants found it difficult to navigate back when making an error but admitted this could be due to 
		   the prototype itself and less of the design. After the participants completed the verbal evaluation i aksed them 
		   to complete a quick survey. This greatly aided in the new direction for the app. I now know that navigation needs to be 
		   improved to allow easier use.</p>

		<h2>Tiana's Analysis</h2>
		<p>Following testing our lo-fi prototype on my roommate and other friend I got more insight into the flow of our 
		app design.  I gave them each an explanation of the project, its purpose and a quick example of how the app works. 
		I gave them the freedom to go about the design how they thought it worked. My roommate liked the overall idea of the app but 
		felt the flow was hard to understand using the index cards. She suggested possibly using a swipe feature instead of the back arrow 
		to go back and forth between pages. This was an understandable comment being that she is a psychology major and wasn't really 
		understanding the concept/purpose of a lo-fi prototype. Her only other comment was that the date on the calendar not have the slashes 
		in between the month, day, and year, but afterwards I explained that you can also change the date using those and the slashes are necessary 
		to indicate that you can do so. My second participant loved the app idea and felt it would be really helpful. He liked the design and layout 
		and implied that it was easy to use and understand. After I let my participates play around with the prototype I asked them both the same series 
		of questions. After analyzing their responses I concluded that there are some weaknesses in our design. We need to make the navigation 
		more obvious creating efficiency, and be consistent with the placement of the hamburger menu. Overall I think this process
		was very helpful and will make of high-fi prototype even better.</p>

		Participant responses: 
		<br>
		
		Jay 
		<br>
		Design Background: No 
		<br>
		1. "My first intinct was to click the login button "
		<br>
		2. Yes, "sometimes I was sure what screen I was on, maybe titles of the pages could be useful"
		<br>
		3. Yes
		<br>
		4. "I liked the idea of the design, and I disliked some parts of the placement of things such as the back button and menu 
		thing, maybe get rid of the back button and be consistent with the menu having two lines or three and always being in the same 
		place on every page."
		<br>
		5. "improvements listed above, overall great job" 
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Jerimiah 
		<br>
		Design Background: Yes 
		<br>
		1. "the textfields didnt have any labels but I assumed I was clicking the username and password textfields" 
		<br>
		2. "nah I wasnt confused, but I can see how someone could be. But I feel like if you use myCourses regularly then 
		it wasnt confusing" 
		<br>
		3. Yes 
		<br>
		4. "I think its a cool app idea. I liked the priority option order for my courses and work, how the calendar not only
		had dates but all specfic times of things, I didnt get why there were check boxes next to the names of what I guess was 
		the classlist, I didnt get why there were lines over the course names on the spring 2022 page. 
		<br>
		5. "Yea there are improvemnets to be made but it definitely has potential"
