		<h2>Analysis</h2>
		<p>Our overall hifi usability testing went well and we got some positive feedback and some constructive criticism. The usability design of the app got positive feedback and it was easy for people to know what meant what when testing the app. They were able to navigate to different sections of the app. The color scheme and text match well with MyCourses integration. Most participants said if it was an actual app they would use it. Some negative feedback was that the priority assignment feature was a little difficult to understand and some things were highlighted when they didnâ€™t need to be. It was also suggested that we add error prevention to prevent users from logging out by accident. Only two of the people we tested agreed to be recorded. Overall we think our app would be in good space to develop after making some more adjustments to the prototype. Overall, if we were going to continue testing we would need to try to make the professor/ staff facing side.
