		<h2>Analysis</h2>
		<p>I tested our index card prototype on two of my residents. They were asked to go through the process of completeing three tasks:
			getting to assignments for a PSYC 240 class, getting to their  Fall 2020 course list and lastly getting to their class list for 
		their ISTE 262 as shown on the index cards. I feel I had to over explain the index cards a bit becasue they weren't familiar with 
			the processes. They were able to complete the tasks after explain with no gudiance. The only issues That I faced when doing 
			this is that they felt the naviagtion was not clear enough/ large enough. The issue was also that for the button to find the classes
			from previous semesters was called sort instead of smething more descriptive or pertaining to the content. Over all naviagetion is 
			something that that we need work on. It was good to see how a user may interact with our app and know what we should
			improve before building the hifi prototype.  </p>
