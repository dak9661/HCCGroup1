        <h2>Stakeholders</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>MyCourses: as an educational software that students at RIT use</li>
            <li>Desire to Learn: the host of mycouress </li>
            <li>A parsing software (Docparser): a softwarre that would parse the information from syllabi</li>
            <li>Current and prospective customers: students, teachers, and parents</li>
	    <li>Faculty</li>
	    <li>TAs</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Our Team Stakeholders</h2>
    <ul>
            <li>Marketing team: Marketing the app to different educational companies or platforms</li>
            <li>Sales team: Selling and branding the team</li>
            <li>Creative team - Designers: People who will work to create the app and design how it would look </li> 
            <li>Developers: the backend of the applications</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Stakeholder Goals: For individuals to efficently scan information and dates into a calendar</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Secure application - this is important for students, professors and all users </li>
            <li>Appealing appearance - impoarnt for all users so it can be user friendly and simple to navigate</li>
            <li>Information is scanned and processed in a timely fashion - ensuring that it doesnt take too much time to scan or else it would be useless</li> 
            <li>Simple to use with featues making it accessible to any potential user - so both parents, professors and students will easily be able to use it</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Worries</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To heavily dependent on parsing software; may not pick up all dates accompanied by 
                information if document is too long </li>
            <li>How will the appearence of the app adapt to a lot of information under one date </li>
        </ul>
