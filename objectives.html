    <h2>Objective</h2>
    
    <p>The objective of this app is to allow its users to sign in and allow it to 
        scan class syllubi to auto populate important dates and assignments onto a calender 
        of their choosing. Also allows for simple psuh notifictaions that can remind users of important dates.
         The main goal of the app is to allow for fast and simple organization.</p>

        <h2>Concerns for website</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Since the app is new our concerns are that the customers would prefer to use their accustomed Calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar or Outlook Calendar)</li>
            <li>UI and visual design would not display nicely on all phone types such as Android and Apple.</li>
            <li>Not accesible enough </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ideas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow user to customize app appearence: User can set appearence to one of the color platte choices we provide also having different accessibility options; Once the user picks the platte of their choice 
		the app will refresh and their desired colors will appear.</li>
            <li>Partnership with education technolgoy companies such as MyCourses so that it is known that our application can easily pair syllabus information. Possibly have it so that along with the syllabus is an ad to download our application. </li>
            <li>Accessible on mobile and desktop devices. The app is responsive and works properly on various devices. </li>
        </ul>
