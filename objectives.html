    <h2>Objective</h2>
    
    <p>The objective of this app is to allow its users to sign in and allow it to 
        scan class syllabi to auto-populate important dates and assignments onto a calendar 
        of their choosing. Also allows for simple push notifications that can remind users of important dates.
         The main goal of the app is to allow for fast and simple organization.</p>

        <h2>Concerns for Mobile App</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Since the app is new our concerns are that the customers would prefer to use their accustomed Calendar (e.g., Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or Outlook Calendar)</li>
            <li>UI and visual design would not display nicely on all phone types such as Android and Apple so using one set of guideline principles would not translate well to another operating system.</li>
            <li>App will be able to use system accessibility features so any needs will be met via device preferences. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ideas</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow user to customize app appearance: User can set appearance to one of the color palette choices we provide also having different accessibility options; Once the user picks the palatte of their choice 
		the app will refresh and their desired colors will appear.</li>
            <li>Partnership with education technology companies such as MyCourses so that it is known that our application can easily pair syllabus information. Possibly have it so that along with the syllabus is an ad to download our application. </li>
            <li>Accessible on mobile and desktop devices. The app is responsive and works properly on various devices. </li>
	    <li>Just in case the parsing software doesn't find correct or proper dates have an option to manually put the date in as well.</li>
        </ul>
